## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project predicts the number of **calories burnt** during a workout session using user input features such as:

- Gender
- Age
- Height
- Weight
- Duration of Exercise
- Heart Rate
- Body Temperature

The machine learning model was trained on a real-world dataset and saved as `calories_model.pkl`, which is loaded and used in the Streamlit app.
